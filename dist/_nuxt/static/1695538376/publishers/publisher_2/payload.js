Each chapter follows a consistent approach: Tanenbaum presents key principles, then illustrates them utilizing real-world example networks that run through the entire book―the Internet, and wireless networks, including Wireless LANs, broadband wireless and Bluetooth. The Fifth Edition includes a chapter devoted exclusively to network security. The textbook is supplemented by a Solutions Manual, as well as a Website containing PowerPoint slides, art in various forms, and other tools for instruction, including a protocol simulator whereby students can develop and test their own network protocols."}]}]},dir:i,path:"\u002Fbooks\u002Fbook_3",extension:f,createdAt:"2023-09-23T19:29:34.904Z",updatedAt:m},{slug:n,id:n,title:"Modern Operating Systems",edition:"4th",copyright:2014,language:g,pages:1136,authorId:l,publisherId:d,image:"books\u002Fbook_4.jpg",toc:[],body:{type:e,children:[{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Modern Operating Systems, Fourth Edition, is intended for introductory courses in Operating Systems in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering programs.
